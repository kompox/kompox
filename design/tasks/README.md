Tasks are intentionally short and specific. Decisions should be captured in ADRs and specifications. Use the YAML front matter fields to ensure consistent indexing.

Old tasks (prior to 2026-02-14) have been archived in [_dev/tasks] for historical reference. They are not included in the main index to keep it focused on current and future work.

Status legend:
- draft: Not started yet
- active: Work in progress
- blocked: Waiting on dependency or decision
- done: Completed; kept for history
- canceled: Stopped intentionally (kept for history)
- superseded: Replaced by a newer task (kept for history)
