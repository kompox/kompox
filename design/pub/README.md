Public docs are materials that have been shared outside the organization, such as conference talks, blog posts, or articles. They serve as a record of our public communication and can be useful for reference and learning. Use the YAML front matter fields to ensure consistent indexing.

Status legend:
- draft: Planned or under preparation; not yet scheduled
- scheduled: Confirmed for a future date
- delivered: Completed and delivered (slides/article published)
