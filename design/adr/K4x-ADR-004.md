## Context

- In Kompox, ingress hostnames appear in `kompoxops.yml` specifically in `cluster.ingress.domain` and `app.ingress.rules[].hosts`. Historically, users needed to manually configure their DNS zone to map these hostnames to the cluster ingress endpoint IP address.
- This manual step is error-prone, time-consuming, and complicates automation. Some providers support first-class DNS services that we can leverage to reduce operational toil.
- We want to introduce an optional capability to apply DNS records for ingress endpoints automatically, while keeping provider-specific DNS integration encapsulated in each provider driver.
- Requirements and constraints:
  - Optional feature (opt-in via configuration or usage path). Existing workflows remain valid.
  - Provider-agnostic API surface in the domain layer; provider-specific resolution and write logic in drivers.
  - Idempotent and best-effort semantics by default. DNS write failures should not break core workflows.
  - Allow warnings/logging when updates fail; only escalate to errors when explicitly requested.
  - Configurability of manageable DNS zones/domains via `cluster.ingress.domain` and/or `cluster.settings` (details vary by driver).

## Decision

Introduce a generic DNS apply capability centered around a record-set abstraction and wire it through the domain port and provider drivers. Implementation details (types, method signatures, flags) are documented in `_dev/tasks`ã€‚

- Domain model
  - Add a provider-agnostic record-set model and type identifiers (e.g., A/AAAA/CNAME/TXT/MX/NS/SRV/CAA) to represent the desired DNS state per FQDN and type.

- Domain port
  - Expose `DNSApply` to apply a single record set per call with options for zone hint, strict mode, and dry-run.
  - Semantics: idempotent and best-effort by default; provider write failures do not surface as errors unless strict mode is enabled.

- Provider drivers
  - Provide a corresponding DNS apply operation and encapsulate provider-specific behaviors including zone discovery/selection, ingress endpoint resolution, and record formatting.

- Scope for ingress automation
  - Drivers may implement helper logic to discover the cluster ingress public address (e.g., LoadBalancer IPs) and upsert `A/AAAA` records for the FQDNs declared in `cluster.ingress.domain` and `app.ingress.rules[].hosts`.
  - The exact way manageable zones are chosen depends on driver configuration (e.g., `cluster.ingress.domain`, provider credentials, and `cluster.settings`).

- Use case layer
  - Introduce `usecase/dns` to orchestrate DNS operations across config, domain model, and drivers.

- CLI
  - Add `kompoxops dns deploy` and `kompoxops dns destroy`. `app deploy/destroy` may optionally invoke the corresponding DNS operation via `--update-dns`.
  - Rationale: aligns with deploy/destroy verbs; DNS deploy covers create/update, DNS destroy covers removal of records deterministically associated to the app (no GC of orphans).

### Operation timing and cleanup policy

DNS records are applied and removed during explicit lifecycle operations: via `kompoxops dns deploy/destroy` or, when `--update-dns` is provided, as part of `kompoxops app deploy/destroy`. The system does not perform background garbage collection; only records deterministically associated with the app are touched, and orphaned or otherwise untrackable records (e.g., after manual `kompoxops.yml` edits) are left unchanged.

## Alternatives Considered

1) Ensure-style API ("DNSEnsure")
    - Pros: conveys intent to achieve a state.
    - Cons: implies strong error semantics; our default must tolerate provider write failures without failing workflows. Rejected.

2) Centralized DNS client in core (no driver delegation)
    - Pros: uniform logic in one place.
    - Cons: would embed provider-specific complexity into core, increase credentials surface, and reduce extensibility. Rejected.

3) Batch apply for multiple record sets in one call
    - Pros: fewer round-trips; bulk operations.
    - Cons: increases API surface and complexity now; can be added later without breaking the single-record API. Deferred.

4) CLI-only automation (scripts) instead of API
    - Pros: minimal code changes.
    - Cons: lacks domain/driver encapsulation and is harder to validate and evolve. Rejected.

## Consequences

- Pros
  - Reduces manual DNS steps for ingress hostnames; improves out-of-the-box automation.
  - Keeps provider-specific logic and credentials localized to drivers.
  - Idempotent best-effort semantics minimize impact on existing flows and resilience during intermittent provider issues.

- Cons/Constraints
  - Exact DNS behavior depends on provider capabilities and configuration; behavior is not fully uniform across drivers.
  - Additional logging and observability are needed to make best-effort outcomes visible to operators.
  - Deletion-by-empty-values is simple but requires clear documentation to avoid surprises.

## Rollout

1) Domain and interface additions
  - Add `DNSRecordType`, `DNSRecordSet`.
  - Extend `ClusterPort` with `DNSApply` and consolidate `ClusterDNSApplyOptions` in `cluster_port.go`.
  - Add `ClusterDNSApply` to provider driver interface.

2) Driver stubs
  - AKS and K3s drivers implement no-op placeholders that log and return nil.

3) Provider implementations
  - Implement DNS updates per provider (e.g., Azure DNS for AKS) with support for `ZoneHint`, `Strict`, and `DryRun`.

4) Use case and CLI wiring
  - Add `usecase/dns` and wire `kompoxops dns deploy/destroy` to it; allow `kompoxops app deploy/destroy --update-dns` to call the same use case flows.
