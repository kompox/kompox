## Repository Copilot Instructions (English)

This repository prefers English for natural-language communication, with Japanese allowed where noted in the repository instructions.

1) Natural language
- Use English by default for comments, PR descriptions, commit messages, and conversational output.
- Japanese may be used when appropriate for files or documentation that are specifically Japanese; see the language guidance files in `.github/instructions` for exact rules and file-scope mappings.

2) Where to find scope and language rules
- Repository-level language/instruction rules are defined in `.github/instructions/en.instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/ja.instructions.md`.

3) Project overview and purpose
- Refer to `docs/Kompox-Spec-Draft.ja.md` for the project overview and goals. That document is the canonical source for the intended behavior and high-level requirements.

4) Architecture guidance
- Follow the architecture guidelines in `docs/Kompox-Arch-v1.ja.md` when proposing design changes, new packages, or infra patterns.
